👩‍🌾 Inspiration

COVID led to a resurgence of interest in gardening worldwide, as people grew plants to stay physically and mentally healthy, relieve stress, and quell worries about food shortages or rising food costs.

While gardening can be done in isolation, it often isn't. Gardening offers a way to socialize safely outdoors. In community gardens, growers are part of a community. Some gardeners with access to large spots to   garden also grew food for their community.

📚 What it does

How's It Growing is a Wix social platform that connects growers with other growers and provides access to a knowledge center via SMS or a phone call through Twilio.

👩‍💻 How we built it

We built the website using Velo by Wix and integrated it with Twilio for the chatbot q&a that offers same info as knowledge center.

😩 Challenges we ran into

As a team of majority novice hackers, coming up and agreeing on an idea, building around it, and ensuring that we all had the same vision took several tries, and we overcame that with regular check in and communications and progress reviews. We also had to coordinate a bit with different time zones. '


There were some features we talked about there were not implemented on the front end, but we coded the back end portion for it, and it was too close to the deadline to test before publishing. Nevertheless, we figured a lot out and implemented many features!

🕸 Accomplishments that we're proud of

For most of us, this is our first time exploring Wix, how it can create a sleek webpage quickly, and the expanse of its widgets and integrations.

🎓 What we learned

For the majority of us, we hadn't used Wix before so we learned the ins and outs of navigating Wix and how collaboration works best when Wix only allows for one editor to be editing the page at a time. We also paved our way in learning how to manage a project and not wait last minute. We also had a lot of discussion about design and user experience and how the product works together to create meaningful experiences for users.

🍂What's next for How's It Growing?

We'd love to curate additional social features for people to connect by allowing them to filter results for local and for online communication and transactions.
